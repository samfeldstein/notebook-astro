[Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/ebooks) supports local bookstores, but sadly, it seems that you can only read ebooks you buy there on Bookshop’s website or app. You can’t read them on your Kindle. (See [Bookshop’s ebook FAQs](https://bookshop.org/info/ebooks) and this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calibre/comments/1ic41b1/bookshoporgs_new_ebooks_anyone_know_what_they_are/). You can read them on your Android e-reader, however, and apparently Bookshop is working with Kobo to bring its eBooks to those devices. (See [I Tried Bookshop.org's New eBooks](https://www.howtogeek.com/i-tried-bookshoporgs-new-ebooks-and-its-not-a-kindle-killer-yet/).)

For more details, refer to Bookshop’s [eBook FAQs](https://bookshop.org/info/ebooks) and [How-to-Geek’s Review](https://www.howtogeek.com/i-tried-bookshoporgs-new-ebooks-and-its-not-a-kindle-killer-yet/).

Kobo has an affiliate program that sends a percentage of your ebook purchase to your favorite local bookstore.
