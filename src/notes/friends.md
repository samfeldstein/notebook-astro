If you leave too many years between contact, can you really say you're friends? Because at some point you’re not serving any purpose in each other‘s lives. So maintaining contact isn't just crucial; it's the whole point. The contact *is* the friendship.

Keep in touch with people. Don’t let them turn into somebody you used to hang out with ten years ago.
