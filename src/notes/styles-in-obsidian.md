If you just need some basic styling, you can use a plugin like [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings). Other plug-ins probably let you do more.

If you want fine control, you can add your own styles to Obsidian by adding files in the CSS snippets folder. Open **Settings > Appearance** and it'll tell you where that folder is.

You can select elements using [Obsidian's provided variables](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/CSS+variables). You can also open DevTools with <kbd>CmdOptI</kbn>.
