## Description

Hi, I'm Sam. I'm traveling full-time this year while I take courses in web development. 

When I'm not building websites, you'll probably find me hiking, exploring the neighborhood, catching a show, catching a movie, writing, reading, or taking photos.

I'll be in the States the rest of the year, but at some point I'd love to go to Europe.

I've done three Workaways at the time of this writing; in Galveston, New Orleans, and Boulder. I've wanted to travel for a long time, but it seemed like I could never make space for it between school, work, and life. I'm glad I'm finally making it happen!

## Skills

I grew up on a farm, so I've spent a lot of time working outside. I've mended fence, pulled weeds, chopped firewood, driven a tractor, shoveled manure, etc.

I rode horses for about thirteen years, starting when I was five or six.

I've been a horseback riding instructor, part-time librarian, freelance journalist, freelance web developer, content writer, teacher's assistant (grad school), script-reader for a Hollywood production company, barista, bartender, and coffee shop manager.

In Southern California I volunteered for an independent movie theater called the Frida, and absolutely loved it.

I went to school for English and writing, and grad-school for screenwriting.

I've been learning to build websites for about a year now. I'm happy to help with that or anything computer- or internet-related. You can see my projects on my personal website, [samfeldstein.xyz](https://samfeldstein.xyz).

I'm an intermediate photographer. I can teach the basics but would love to learn more, especially about color correction and editing. I've never shot on film, and would love to learn that too.

## What elseâ€¦

If there's anything you'd like to know about me that I haven't mentioned, just ask!
