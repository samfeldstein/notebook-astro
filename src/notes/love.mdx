There is only one component in the experience most people call "love" that does not have another name: *the bittersweet, ennobling feeling we experience when we sacrifice ourselves for the good of the other.* The more significant the sacrifice (in terms of both cost to self and benefit to other), the more poignant the experience. Love thinks only of the good of the loved one, even if (or rather, especially if) it means a loss of the self. In fact, the less self there is, the more love there can be. This is because love is the humiliated self, triumphant. It is a kind of proud embarrassment, or a majestic shamelessness. In any case, it is the component of the experience of love that has no other name. This means it should not be possible to experience the triumph of the humiliated itself without love. Anyone uplifted by self sacrifice for the good of the other *loves*. It is the necessary and sufficient condition.
