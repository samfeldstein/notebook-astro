## Get a degree

I'm looking at [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html). Next steps are to do some more research. See if it's a good fit and what alumni have to say. 

## Network

I've already joined some [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/home/). You could also volunteer with an organization like [ISSA](https://www.denverissa.org/about).

## Get a job

The WGU degree comes with an IT certification. If possible, use that to get a help desk job while you go to school.
