Do things that bring joy into the world. Without joy, life isn’t worth living. Joy is the whole point.

If we had nothing else to worry about, we be concerned with making life as fun as possible.

Every innovation means to solve a problem. What if there were no problems? Then what would the problem be? To elevate experience. To combat ennui.

A lot of people in America and the First World are already at this point. They don't really have much to worry about. They might not be rich, but they can complain about how expensive everything is while eating a $23 hamburger.

[Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/unfolding):

> To find a good relationship, you do not start by saying, “I want a relationship that looks like this.” That would be starting in the wrong end. Instead you say, “I’m just going to pay attention to what happens when I hang out with various people and iterate toward something that feels alive.”

But even then, what's the end goal? Looking for one person? I think you have to dispense with idea of a perfect end goal. So in that sense you aren't iterating **toward** anything. There is no endpoint. There is just now, and what we make of it.

Is it right to even have a goal in this context? Because what happens when we're searching? We're going to find what we're looking for, whether it's there or not.

But I don't know that it's bad to have a goal. Just nothing too specific. Not a checklist. But as he says, pay attention to what feels alive, what fills the void, what feels meaningful. That feel of fulfillment is what you're living for. To check some boxes, but to feel alive. 

Is it appropriate to *seek,* is what I'm asking. I don't know if being on the hunt feels right, but being on the lookout does. Pay attention, as Karlsson says.

I think I avoid writing because if I wrote, I would have to write about what I think which means writing about. I would have to write about what's on my mind which is the great terror, but you can't just live your life avoiding the terror because if you do, you'll just spend your life running and never doing anything to mitigate the terror or alleviate not crush it or to spell it I don't think they can be done, but to do everything you possibly can to disempower it and really that means living a life of joy, not hedonistic and not carefree but filling your life with good satisfying things with people you love and things you've made yourself

Is it possible that everything we ever do is just a distraction to keep us from contemplating the inevitable? Is that what makes writing brave? Or does it just make it futile?

## Values

To figure out how to live a good life, you have to establish values. The particulars are less important than living according to a set of values. There are infinite iterations. So instead of trying to control the outcome, try to live according to a set of principles, and adhere to them.

If you find it impossible to adhere to them in a given situation, redefine your principles, or remove yourself from the situation.

People are reluctant to do this because we look down on people who being imperfect will inevitably violate their self-defined principles. Nobody wants to be a hypocrite, so it's better to just not have principles in the first place.
