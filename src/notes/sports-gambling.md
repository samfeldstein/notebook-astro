Why are men so susceptible? I think it's because they crave novelty, adventure, and risk. They crave a rush. Gambling caters to a desire that isn't just powerful but vital. Few feelings beat the thrill that comes from paying off a risk.[^1]

And sports gambling lets people scratch that itch while allowing them to feel relatively safe. There's no physical danger involved. Sports gambling companies do what all billion-dollar internet companies do: they take something people want, and make it really, really easy to get.

[^1]: And not just gamblers, but competitors of all stripes. Winning feels good, and the opportunity to win appears rarely, and usually in isolated settings: sports, sports gambling, other types of gambling.
