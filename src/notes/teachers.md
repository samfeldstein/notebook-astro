Great teachers don't just teach a skill. They teach an approach. Bob, my riding instructor, taught me to work smarter, not harder, and to look where I'm going. Ryan, my poetry professor, taught me that a [car is a chair with four wheels](https://samfeldstein.xyz/blog/what-is-rain/). Captain Jack (not sparrow), taught me to apply only as much pressure as needed. Dirt, my jiu-jitsu coach, taught me to take my time.

Great teachers teach ingredients, not recipes.
