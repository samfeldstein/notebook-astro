There are five surfaces:

1. Perimeter layer
2. Network layer
3. Endpoint layer
4. Application layer
5. Data layer

The **perimeter layer** involves authentication systems that validate user access.

The **network layer** is made up of technologies like network firewalls and others.

The **endpoint layer** comprises devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers.

The **application layer** is software.

The **data layer** is information, whether stored, in transit, or in use.
