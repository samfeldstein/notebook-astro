## Pressing concerns

I'm trying to decide if I should major in Computer Science, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, or both.

I'm leaning toward compsci because I'm want to find a job in programming or cybersecurity, and both of those seem like they're “downstream” of compsci. My sense is that compsci will give me more options for the future.

### My interest in programming

I enjoy programming and frequently build little tools for myself (eg, a python script to track my writing hours and average words). I'm pretty knowledgable about web programming, and I've built a number of websites using static site generators, but I'm not interested in frontend as a career.

I enjoy writing programs that are efficient and easy to maintain. I'm most interested in python. Is that a sound choice? What careers are available to python devs? Are there other languages with more promising outlooks?

I'm worried about job security. I'm worried about AI automating away software jobs. I don't want to get a degree only to discover I'm unemployable in five years.

### My interest in cybersecurity

I'm most interested in threat intelligence and ethical hacking, but I have little experience doing either of these, so I can't be sure I'm a good fit.

Is this an appropriate major for someone with little IT experience?

## Other questions

How long will it take to graduate if I'm working toward my degree 20 hrs/week?
