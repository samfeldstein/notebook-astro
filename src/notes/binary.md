Binary is the base-2 numbering system. That means each digit can have one of two values: 0 or 1.

To calculate the value of [[positional-notation|positional numbers]], we calculate the actual values of its digits and add them together. To find the actual value of a digit, we multiply the digit ($d$) by the base ($b$) to the power of the digit's position ($p$):

$$d \times b^p$$

## Example

Binary is the base-2 numbering system, so $b = 2$.  Given the binary number 011, we can calculate its value like so:

$$(0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3$$
