## The Future of Digital Notetaking

Digital notetaking is probably a primitive attempt to manually create neural networks in our brains. So the goal of all such technology (like [[anki|Anki]]), is to reduce the gap between the knowledge we put in the computer and the knowledge we put in our head. And I guess the perfect version of that system would be one that permits *Matrix*-style "uploading" of knowledge directly to the brain.
