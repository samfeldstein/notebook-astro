I had pain in my hands, so I switched keyboard layouts. I went with Colemak because its included on most operating systems.

I switched on March 5th, 2025. As of May 28, 2025, my average typing speed over the last ten tests is 64 word per minute. My pain is *much* better.

As of Sept. 2nd, my speed over the last ten tests is 69 words per minute. *Slow is smooth, smooth is fast* really seems to hold up here.

I'm tracking my progress with [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).
