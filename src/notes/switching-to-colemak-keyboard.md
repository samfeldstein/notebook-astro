I had pain in my hands, so I switched keyboard layouts. I went with Colemak because its included on most operating systems.

Switched on March 5th, 2025. As of May 28, 2025, my average typing speed over the last ten tests is 64 word per minute. My pain is *much* better.

I'm tracking my progress with [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).
