A radix (also called a base) is the number of unique digits, including zero, that a [[positional-notation|positional number system ]] uses to represent numbers.

For example, the decimal system uses the digits 0 through 9, so its radix is 10. (In math, we often start counting at 0 because we need to be able to represent nothing.)
