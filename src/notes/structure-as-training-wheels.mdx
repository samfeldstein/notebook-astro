Structures are like training wheels. They can be taken off once you learn to balance.

The slot in West Coast swing is a structure. I’ve been dancing less than a year, but I suspect that at some point the slot, like training wheels, can be dispensed with. Same goes for the six-count basic.

Structure here is distinct from a form or medium, eg watercolors or celluloid.
