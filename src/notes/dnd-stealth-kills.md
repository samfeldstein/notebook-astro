- ***The Kill Zone.*** In order to stealth-kill a target, the attacker must strike the target’s vitals, known as the kill zone.
- ***Melee Attacks.*** If the attacker is wielding a melee weapon, they must approach the target undetected. Perception checks (including [passive](https://5thsrd.org/rules/abilities/dexterity/#initiative)) made by the target to detect the attacker have advantage.
- ***Ranged Attacks.*** Because the shot is so precise, the target gains a +5 to its AC against ranged attacks that target its kill zone. Note that the attacker may miss the kill zone but still hit the target.
- ***Lethal Strike.*** If the attacker hits the target’s kill zone, they score an automatic critical hit. If the target has hit points remaining after the damage is dealt, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die.
- ***Surprise.*** The target of an attempted stealth kill is [surprised](https://5thsrd.org/combat/order_of_combat/#surprise) even if the attack misses.
