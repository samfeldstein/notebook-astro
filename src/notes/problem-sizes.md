Problems vary in size. *Build a website* is a big problem. *Position the menu bar* is a small problem. Break your problem down until you get to a problem small enough to solve.

Problem sizes are proportional. *Build a website* is a big problem compared to *position the menu bar*, but it's a small problem compared to *make electricty free.*

Problem sizes, being proportional, only matter in context. The context is the scope of your responsibility. If your job is to make electricity free, then building a website to showcase your plan falls within that scope. But if you're the guy hired to build the website, that's the biggest problem you have.
