- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights)
	- The **Explore** tab lets you set an approximate destination and date and it'll send you cheap flights.
- [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) is a catchall. Covers all forms of transportation.
- [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com/). I was told this was the best site to find cheap flights, but in my experience it's comparable to Google.
- [Matt's Flights](https://www.mattsflights.com). Not sure what this is, but must have heard about it somewhere.
