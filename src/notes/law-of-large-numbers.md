The Law of Large Numbers states that the more times an experiment is repeated, the closer the average result gets to [[the-expectation|the expectation]].

Imagine you flip a fair coin. The "true" average for heads or tails is 50% because each side has an equal chance of landing up.

If you flip the coin just 10 times, you might get something like 7 heads and 3 tails — not exactly 50-50, which is common in small trials.

But if you flip the coin 1000 times, the heads and tails results will start to even out, getting closer to 50% heads and 50% tails. The more times you flip, the closer you’ll get to this "true" 50-50 split.

So, the law of large numbers tells us that with many trials, we’ll approach the expected outcome — in this case, half heads and half tails.
