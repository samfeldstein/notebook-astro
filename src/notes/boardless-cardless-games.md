## Murder Wink 'em

Everyone sits in a circle and draws a piece of paper from a bucket. Most are blank, but one will have an M or something to identify the "murderer." A person is killed when the murderer makes eye contact and winks. The more dramatic and drawn out the death the better. The murder tries to "kill" as many people as they can without anyone seeing who they are and identifying them.

## Get Down, Mr President.

When you're with a group of friends, you put your hand up to your ear, like you're a secret service agent. As people notice you doing it, they do it, too. Whoever's last to do it gets tackled by everyone else as they yell "Get down, Mr President!"

## Fortunately, Unfortunately

A storytelling game where players take turns adding one sentence to a continuous story. The first person starts with a "fortunately" sentence, the next adds an "unfortunately" sentence, and so on, building a hilariously dramatic narrative.

## 321

Count down and say a word. Count down again and say another word related to the first two words. Repeat until you say the same word.

## Ghost

Players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment without actually finishing a valid word. For example, if the letters are "C-H-A-S," the next player must add a letter that could lead to a word (like "T" for "chaste") but loses the round if they complete a word (like adding "E" to make "chase").

## Who am I?

*Inglourious Basterds* game.

## Twenty Questions

## Hot and Cold

One person leaves the room while the group chooses a secret action they must perform (e.g., "sit on a specific chair"). When the player returns, the group can only "cheer" (hotter) or "boo" (colder) to guide them toward the action.
