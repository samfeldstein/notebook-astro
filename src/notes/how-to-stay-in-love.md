There seems to be some kind of thermostat operating in healthy marriages that regulates the balance between positivity and negativity, preserving a sound emotional ecology. It's as if when partners in a stable marriage get contemptuous they correct it with lots of positivity, not necessarily right away, but sometime soon.

The balance also implies a strange thing: that certain kinds of negativity may actually have some positive function in marriages. For example, some degree of negativity may help keep sexual passion in a marriage. Many couples have experienced the aphrodisiacal effect of a good fight—once it's time to make up. Perhaps for such couples certain kinds of negativity act like fuel that reignites desire. It's role in a healthy marriage may be to spur a cycle of closeness and distance that can renew love and affection.
