I use [FeedBro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/) to find feeds. FeedBro is also a reader, but I don't use that feature.

Once you've added the extension to your browser, click the icon and you'll see an option to `Find Feeds in Current Tab`. It may or may not find one, and this may or may not be because the website doesn't have one. It's possible the website does have a feed but it's not listed on the current page.

If the button doesn't return a feed, you can try a few more things:

1. <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + F</kbd> for *rss* or *atom* or *feed*
2. Google the website name + *rss feed* or *atom feed*
3. Add `/feed` or `/feed.xml` to the end of the base URL (eg, `notes.samfeldstein.xyz/feed.xml`

If none of those work, the site probably doesn't have a feed.

RSS isn't just for news sites and blogs. Reddit and YouTube, among others, generate feeds for each forum and channel.
