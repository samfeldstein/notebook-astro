There seems to be some kind of thermostat operating in healthy marriages that regulates the balance between positivity and negativity, preserving a sound emotional ecology. It's as if when partners in a stable marriage get contemptuous they correct it with lots of positivity, not necessarily right away, but sometime soon.

The balance also implies a strange thing: that certain kinds of negativity may actually have some positive function in marriages. For example, some degree of negativity may help keep sexual passion in a marriage. Many couples have experienced the aphrodisiacal effect of a good fight—once it's time to make up. Perhaps for such couples certain kinds of negativity act like fuel that reignites desire. It's role in a healthy marriage may be to spur a cycle of closeness and distance that can renew love and affection.

A great many of the issues that people are subject to encountering in their relationships are based on *a failure to adequately appreciate the realities of the balance of attraction.* For instance, they want power without accountability — or the feeling of being loved without giving up control. *This is not possible.* Each position in the balance of attraction has its benefits and liabilities. Trying to secure the benefits of both while attempting to avoid the liabilities of either is a fool's errand. That's because the price of power *is* responsibility, and the cost of being in love *is* control. Acceptance of these facts is a pre-condition to having successful, harmonious relationships.
