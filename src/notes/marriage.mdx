Among other factors, the marital ideal consists of a wedding, illegal contract, asylum oath before God, emotional commitment, resource provision, sexual exclusivity, cohabitation, and child rearing. This means that every spouse must be a celebrant, a business partner, a soulmate, a best friend, a sponsor, a monopolized, lover, roommate, and apparent. What's more, this ideal somehow expects each partner to unite the security in stability of companion love with the passion and excitement of romantic love. And with the decline of civic communities and extended networks, each person is required to perform countless ancillary roles, previously discharged by an entire village: nurse, therapist, playmate, cheerleader, activity, buddy, chef, mistress, personal assistant.

In so many words, marriages fail because people want it to be too many things.
