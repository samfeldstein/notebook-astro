The beauty of *love your neighbor as yourself* is that it's self-justifying. If you want people to be kind to you, be kind to people. We don't need a godhead to take this moral imperative seriously. And if we do, I think that's a bad sign. It means we only ever do the right thing because we're told to. If we want to mature as a species, we need to adopt these moral principles as our own, and stand by them for their own sake.
