My research shows that much more important than having compatible views is *how* couples work out their differences. In fact, occasional discontent, especially in a marriage's early years, seems to be good for the union in the long run.

If there is one lesson I have learned from my years of research it is that *a lasting marriage results from a couple's ability to resolve the conflicts that are inevitable in any relationship.*

No matter what style your marriage follows, you must have at least five times as many positive as negative moments together if you're marriage is to be stable.

Marriages which emphasize communication and compromise have long been held up as the ideal. Yet, after tracking the fate of so many couples over the years, I have had to reject the notion that there is only one type of successful marriage.

The only thing that can save you and your partner is an unerring _respect_ for one another. It’s crucial that you hold each other in high esteem, believe in one another—often more than you each believe in yourselves—and trust that your partner is doing his/her best with what they’ve got.
