- I want to be someone people want to dance with. I want my leading to be gentle but clear, and confident. I want it to feel good.
- I want to be a beautiful dancer. I want to learn how to shape my body.
- I want to create a unique shape with every song, instead of just doing the same moves over and over.
- I want to immerse myself in the dance. I want to learn to quiet my mind and relax such that the world becomes precisely the size of the dance. I want to learn how to get there myself, and how to bring my follow with me.
- I want to connect with my follow. I want to learn how to achieve that mind-meld that lets you create a dance together.
	- I want to learn how to read my follow, how to respond and adapt and give them space to express themselves.
