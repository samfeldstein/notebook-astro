When I look at the websites I've made, I like to think I "built" them "by hand." But if I think about it, it's not true. I didn't "build" them. The computer built them. I just wrote the blueprints.

So programs might be hand*written*. But that has the same feel to it as hand-dipped corndogs. Is there any meaningful difference between a hand-dipped corndog and a machine-dipped corndog? That is to say, even if there is a difference, is it a difference the consumer cares about?
