## *Typishly*

Hello Sam.

Thanks for submitting your work. Regretfully, we won't be adding it to our pages on Typishly. Only a fraction of what we receive is selected, so even very good writing must sometimes be left out.

We're grateful you chose to share your creativity with us. Strong premise: 'In my game, I am God... I too dwell in the clouds.' Smiled at: 'I like to take naps too.' Notable writing: 'Their mouths will open at my behest.' Well expressed: 'spirits, rain-battered and seared by rage, will harden into a bulwark against my love.' Clever notion: 'Before I go, I will leave my people with a gift: the hope that I will return.'

Be well. Be creative.

Jon
