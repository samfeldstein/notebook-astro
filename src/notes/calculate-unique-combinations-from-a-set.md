The number of unique combinations from a set of $i$ items each with $s$ possible states is:

$$
s^i
$$

For example, binary digits have two possible states: 0 and 1. For $i$ binary digits, the total number of unique combinations is $2^i$. For 3 binary digits, there are $2^3 = 8$ unique combinations. And so on.
