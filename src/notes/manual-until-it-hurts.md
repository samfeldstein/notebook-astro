Don't automate anything until you really need to. Otherwise, you may spend more time solving and maintaining the "solution" than addressing the actual problem.

If you do need to automate, follow these rules from Tanek:

1. If you find yourself repeatedly solving the same (especially annoying) problem, create a re-usable solution that works for you.
2. Write up your problem statement/use-case in one sentence.
3. Publish your solution on your personal site with a short paragraph description and a re-use/remix friendly license (like Creative Commons)
